I - General Notes on devIocStats - All Operating Systems
--------------------------------------------------------

Include either devIocStats.dbd OR devVxStats.dbd in the IOC application, 
not both.  devIocStats.dbd (preferred) provides DTYPs that start with 
"IOC" and devVxStats.dbd provides DTYPs that start with "VX" 
(included for backwards compatibility).

String (stringin) Records (DTYP = "IOC stats"), INP = @one of the following:
============================================================================
		startup_script_[12]	-path of startup script (2 records)
					Default - uses STARTUP and ST_CMD
					environment variables or startup and
				        st_cmd symbols.  If STARTUP
					is not available, uses 
					IOCSH_STARTUP_SCRIPT.
		bootline_[1-6]		-CPU bootline (6 records)
					 (set to "<not implemented> for all
					  except RTEMS and vxWorks)
 		bsp_rev			-CPU board support package revision
					 (set to "<not available> for all
					  except RTEMS and vxWorks)
		kernel_ver		-OS kernel build version
		epics_ver		-EPICS base version
                engineer                -IOC Engineer
					Default - uses ENGINEER env var or
					engineer symbol.  If ENGINEER is
					not available, uses LOGNAME or USER
					env var.
                location                -IOC Location
					Default - uses LOCATION env var or
					location symbol.
                hostname                -IOC Host Name from gethostname
                pwd[1-2]                -IOC Current Working Directory 
					  (2 records) from getcwd
                up_time                 -IOC Up Time

	Except for up_time, the support is static.  The record only needs to 
	be processed once, for which SCAN=Passive and PINI=YES is recommended.

	When a string cannot be determined, the PV will show "<not available>" 
	or "<not implemented>" or some other variation.

String (stringin) Records (DTYP = "IOC epics var"), INP = @<EPICS variable>
============================================================================
	The record will report an error if INP is not a valid EPICS variable
	listed in envDefs.h.

	Gets the value of the EPICS environment variable in the INP field
	using envGetConfigParam.  The record only needs to be processed once, 
	for which SCAN=Passive and PINI=YES is recommended.

String (stringin) Records (DTYP = "IOC env var"), INP = @<environment variable>
============================================================================
	Gets the value of the environment variable in the INP field.
	Unless the environment variable changes on-the-fly, the record only 
	needs to be processed once, for which SCAN=Passive and PINI=YES is 
	recommended.

	If the environment variable does not exist, the PV will show 
	"<not available>".

Analog In (ai) Records (DTYP = "IOC stats"), INP = @one of the following:
=========================================================================
                records		 - number of records
		ca_clients	 - number of current CA clients
		ca_connections	 - number of current CA connections
		suspended_tasks	 - number of suspended tasks
	The following two are implemented for posix systems only: 
		proc_id	 	 - process ID
		parent_proc_id   - parent process ID
	The following are implemented for RTEMS, vxWorks, and some soft IOCs 
	(see notes below for exceptions and more detail):
		free_bytes	 - number of bytes not allocated
				   on this machine
		allocated_bytes  - number of bytes allocated
				   (for soft IOCs, physical memory used 
				    at the moment (RSS))
		total_bytes      - number of bytes physically installed
				   on this machine
                sys_cpuload	 - estimated percent CPU load on the system 
                no_of_cpus       - number of CPU cores on the system
                ioc_cpuload      - estimated percent CPU utilization by this 
				   IOC
		fd		 - number of file descriptors currently in use
		max_fd		 - max number of file descriptors
	  Note - free_bytes, total_bytes, sys_cpuload, no_of_cpus
	         can be instantiated once per system instead of per IOC
		 if desired (ie, when multiple IOCs run on the same system).
	The following are implemented for RTEMS and vxWorks IOCs only and
        set to 0 for other types of IOCs:
		max_free	 - size of largest free block
                min_sys_mbuf	 - minimum percent free system MBUFs
                sys_mbuf	 - number of system MBUFs
                inp_errs	 - number of IF input  errors 
                out_errs	 - number of IF output errors
	The following are implemented for vxWorks IOCs only and
        set to 0 for other types of IOCs:
		free_blocks	 - number of blocks in IOC not allocated

                workspace_total_bytes - number of RAM workspace total bytes

Analog In (ai) Records for Cluster Statistics (RTEMS and vxWorks IOCs only)
(DTYP = "IOC stats clusts"), INP = @clust_info <pool> <index> <type> where:
==========================================================================
		pool		 - 0 (data) or 1 (system)
				   (the data pool is not implemented for RTEMS
                                    and all data pool values are set to 0)
		index		 - index into cluster array

======================================================
		rebootProc	 - System reset or epics exit.
		scanMon		 - Calculate time between record updates.
				   Set INAM to scanMonInit.

II - Notes on Soft IOC Implementation of devIocStats
----------------------------------------------------

(1) The suspended task count will only include tasks that call 
    taskwdInsert on startup, including all of iocCore tasks and all sequence 
    tasks.  Some (many?) support modules that create tasks neglect to call 
    taskwdInsert.

(2) The reboot subroutine record will exit the IOC process.  It is assumed
    some soft IOC managing process will automatically restart the soft IOC. 

(3) None of the available methods returns a true value for CPU utilization 
    for multi-threaded applications on multi-core systems.  

(4) Implementation of system CPU utilization on Linux and Solaris show the 
    same values as "top".  A posix implementation that uses getrusage() is
    provided for MacOS where everything else seems to be unavailable.

(5) Implementation of IOC CPU utilization return 0%-100% of CPU load with 
    respect to the system (divided by the number of CPUs where applicable).
    On Solaris, this matches the "top" results. On Linux, "top" 
    normalizes the process values per core 
    (so that top_value = ioc_cpuload*no_of_cpus).  To allow showing or changing 
    the normalization, support for the number of CPUs is provided so that a 
    calc record can be used to get the desired value.

(6) Memory usage is available for Linux only.

(7) The following records can be instantied per system instead of per IOC 
    if desired (value is the same for all IOCs on the same system):
	free_bytes, total_bytes, sys_cpuload, no_of_cpus


IV - Notes on RTEMS Implementation of devIocStats by Till Straumann
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Memory / Heap Statistics
========================

- gathering heap statistics could be expensive; I wouldn't
  want to run this too often w/o knowing how it is implemented
  and how it could impact the running system.

  Furthermore, vxStats reports 'free', 'used' and 'total' memory.
  Unfortunately, it just assumes 'total = free + used' instead
  of the correct total number (difference could give a hint about
  fragmentation). However, if you know the true total amount of
  memory you can estimate fragmentation in your head...

- RTEMS also uses a so-called 'workspace' memory
  area which is independent of the malloc heap.
  Some system-internal data structures are
  allocated from the workspace area.

CPU Load Estimate from the IDLE Task (from Phil Sorensen at CHESS)
====================================

-  The cpu usage is done the same way as in cpukit/libmisc/cpuuse
   from the RTEMS source.

-  Comment from Till:
	The way they determine CPU usage is more appropriate
	but only so if the 'billing' algorithm has access to a high
	resolution clock. This is the case for powerpc under 4.9.
	The code would have to be modified to make use of the
	high resolution clock however.

	If no high resolution clock is available the 'billing' is always
	in ticks even if no full tick period is used. This tends to show
	too high usage numbers.

CPU Load Estimate from miscu_cpu_load_percentage in ssrlApps
============================================================

	#include <ssrlAppsMiscUtils.h>

	which defines

	  double
	  miscu_cpu_load_percentage(
	          struct timespec *lst_uptime,
	          struct timespec *lst_idletime
	  );

	and

	  void
	  miscu_cpu_load_percentage_init(
	          struct timespec *lst_uptime,
	          struct timespec *lst_idletime
	  );

	The header also documents the semantics.

	In particular, be prepared for NAN which is
	also returned under pre-4.9 RTEMS versions
	so your iocAdmin code could try the new
	routine during initialization and fall back
	to the vxStats method if NAN is returned.

	One last thing: if you want to try this
	routine from the CEXP shell then keep in
	mind that CEXP has no way to know the
	type of the return value of any function;
	it just assumes 'long'. You can, however
	force CEXP to recast a symbol (in this case
	to a function-returning-double pointer) so
	you do (note the exclamation mark which deviates
	from the C syntax. It tells Cexp that
	you really want to redefine an already
	known symbol.) :

	Cexp@ioclab1> double (*miscu_cpu_load_percentage)() !

	Cexp@ioclab1> miscu_cpu_load_percentage()
	3.603457
	Cexp@ioclab1>

Networking (Mbufs)
==================

The RTEMS/BSD stack has only one pool of mbufs
and only uses two sizes: MSIZE (128b) for 'ordinary'
mbufs, and MCLBYTES (2048b) for 'mbuf clusters'.
Therefore, the 'data' pool is empty. However,
the calculation of MinDataMBuf always shows usage
info of 100% free (but 100% of 0 is still 0).

Suspended Tasks
===============

Note that e.g., the rtems GDB agent uses a
helper task which is suspended most of the time. Hence on systems
where the agent is active a count of 1 suspended task is normal.

Reboot
======

In RTEMS there is no general 'reset/reboot' system call. The idea
is that the RTEMS application is terminated using 'exit()' which
should allow a firmware monitor to resume. However, on some boards
this is not possible (and 'exit' would not by itself reset the hardware).

For rtems 4.9.1, the bsp_reset function is available on most BSP's which 
performs a hard reset of the CPU (but not necessarily a VME reset).


Misc IOC Info
=============

The startup script, engineer and ioc_location information is simply
read from environment variables "INIT", "ENGINEER" and "LOCATION",
respectively. Of course, these variables (in particular "INIT") must
somehow be set e.g., (when using GeSys) via the BOOTP commandline.
This could have been implemented in a more 'vxworks-alike' way by
looking up symbols via cexpsh but using env-vars seems more
generic/portable to me.

BSP Revision is currently not implemented (since this info is IIRC
not present in RTEMS proper; for BSPs distributed with RTEMS the
revision matches the kernel revision, however).
