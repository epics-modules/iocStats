Release Notes for iocStats
--------------------------

iocStats-R3-1-3: Aug 10, 2010
  * Changes by Ralph Lange:
    - Made python script work for python2.4
    - Fixed Makefiles to work on solaris (gcc)
    - Removed unnecessary posix default for osdMemUsage.c
    - Fixed solaris pid_t (=long) issue in BSlib.c
    - Added ioc_cpuload (CPU utilization of IOC instance)
      and sys_cpuload (CPU load of system) with implementations:
      - using getrusage() for posix (used on Darwin)
      - using /proc file system reads on Linux
      - using /proc reads and kernel statistics on Solaris
      - using the sys_cpuload value for ioc_cpuload on RTEMS and vxWorks

    - Per Ernest, move iocAdmin.db to iocAdminVxWorks.db 
      (deprecate iocAdmin.db).

      Remove iocAdmin-dependency from testIocStatsApp.  Remove undocumented
      executables (ioc_stats, rdbls, rdbapplist) from testIocStatsApp.

iocAdmin-R3-1-1: July 14, 2009
  * iocAdmin/srcDisplay - LCLS display update - add ioc_stats_release.edl.

    creating a display with RELEASE module versions..

iocAdmin-R3-1-0: July 7, 2009
  * devIocStats - Ralph Lange made changes.  Here are his notes:
	Functionality is basically as before, the main work (quite a bit more 
	than I expected) being the split-up of all the devIocStatsOSD.c files 
	into functionally separate source files. (So that any single 
	functionality may be not implemented for an architecture and fall-back 
	to os/posix or os/default.) That split-up includes new names and APIs 
	between the generic part of the device support and the OSD parts, 
	which I tried to streamline, which allowed for some serious code 
	simplifications in the generic parts. I also made sure the new APIs 
	will make it a lot easier to support waveform records.

	I fixed a few bugs in the code (IFerrors and uptime under vxWorks) and 
	added (in the attached version) kernel version and CPU usage info for 
	posix systems.

	Added mem->total to the meminfo structure to create reasonable 
	information on soft IOC implementations with virtual memory 
	organization:
	   total:  on this host - physically installed memory.
	   used:   for this IOC - physical memory used at the moment (RSS)
	   free:   on this host - physical memory that is available to 
		   processes  (free plus cache plus buffers)
	Added memory implementation for Linux, FD usage implementations for 
	Linux and Solaris.
  * iocAdmin/srcDisplay - LCLS display update.
  * iocAdmin/src - Added python scripts by Dayle Kotturi for automatically
    creating a database and display with RELEASE module versions..
  * iocAdmin/Db - Add iocAdminSoft and iocAdminRTEMS databases for soft 
    and RTEMS IOCs.  Add MEM_MAX.  Process CLUST records only after MBUF_FREE
    records are processed.
  * iocAdmin/srcRestore - Add iocAdminSoft.cwConfig for soft IOCs.
  * configure/RULES_BUILD - Add rules for building a database and display
    with RELEASE module versions.

  * devIocStats/os/RTEMS/devIocStatsOSD.h - change by Sue Witherspoon so that
    bsp_reset is only used for PPC and uC5282.

iocAdmin-R2-1-4: Mar 23, 2009

    and UDF=0 when valid env var but just no value.
  * devIocStats/src/Makefile and 
    devIocStats/src/os/RTEMS/devIocStatsOSD.h - use bsp_reset for uC5282 and 
    all BSPs on RTEMS 4.9.1.
  * devIocStats/src/os/RTEMS/devIocStatsOSD.c - prevent negative cpu load.
