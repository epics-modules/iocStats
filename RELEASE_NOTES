iocStats-R3-1-15: Nov 3, 2016
  * Changes by Mark Rivers:
    - Improved the layout of the medm files to avoid overlapping widgets, etc.
    - Added ioc_stats_reloadacf_confirm.edl to iocAdmin/srcDisplay/Makefile, 
      and put files in that Makefile in alphabetical order to help spot 
      missing files.  
    - Fixes for mingw compiler.  
      Define WINVER to be XP on MINGW to avoid compiler warnings.
      Define WINVER to be XP (0x501) rather than WIN2K (0x500) for consistency.
  * Changes by Keenan Lang:
    - Define WINVER on MinGW.
  * Changes by Tim Mooney:
    - Don't build testIocStats unless SNCSEQ is defined in configure/RELEASE.
  * Changes by Ronald Mercado:
    - Fix devIocStatsGetPwd return value to make WIN32 consistent with posix.
  * Changes by Jeong Han Lee:
    - Replaced _SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF (The number of processors configured) 
      with _SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN (The number of processors currently online).
  * Changes by S. Allison:
    - Use standard RELEASE file instead of LCLS-style RELEASE/RELEASE_SITE.
    - Update .gitignore.
iocStats-R3-1-14: Apr 29, 2015
  * Change to vxWorks osdFdUsage.c to not check the first 3 FDs by Scott Baily:
    Unfortunately, the first 3 file descriptors on vxWorks are special 
    (standard in, standard out, and standard error).  The pointers in 
    iosFdTable have the value FFFFFFFF. For 6.6 and above the reference 
    count isn't checked so there's no problem. But some of our systems use 
    6.3 and this code causes reads from page 0 of RAM.  
  * Change to add process ID and parent process ID records.
  * Change to use github.
  * Change to perform most statistics in a thread separate from record
    processing.
iocStats-R3-1-13: July 13, 2014
  * Bug fix in update period AO record initialization.
iocStats-R3-1-12: June 19, 2014
  * Change by Eric Bjorklund:
    Change devIocStatsGetClusterInfo().  The fundamental problem is that 
    vxWorks -- at least ours (6.8) -- does not fill in all of the entries 
    in the cluster table.  In our example, only 8 of the 13 allocated table 
    entries are filled in, and when devIocStatsGetClusterInfo() tries to 
    process the 9th it gets a page fault exception from the null pointer.
  * Change by Tim Mooney:
    Add caQtDM displays, translated from the .adl files using caQtDM 3.7.8. 
  * Change by Stephanie Allison:
    Added waveform support for epics version, startup script, 
    application directory, and bootline.
  * Changes by Ben Franksen and Ralph Lange:
    - Scan rates now floating point instead of integer.
    - we have recently discovered some bugs in devIocStats in the vxWorks
      implementation that measures the cpu load, which result in wrong 
      results to be displayed. I hacked away at the problem for some days 
      and ended up with a complete re-write. The solution considerably 
      reduces code size and complexity, is therefore much easier to 
      understand and maintain, and --most importantly--
      works correctly. It also contains some additional features:

      * A test procedure that measures how well the initial calibration 
        works by doing it for a number of times and gathering statistics 
	(min, max, avg). This was useful to determine how long initial 
	calibration should run (the default is 30 clock ticks which on a 
	mv2100 gives me a variation of less than 0.4%).

      * Another test procedure (to be called from the shell) adds exactly 
        50% load to the IOC (it burns cpu for one clock tick, then sleeps 
	for one, and repeats that in a loop for the given duration), so one 
	can see whether the measured cpu load increases appropriately 
	(it does on my test machines).

      * Experienced users can customize behaviour to a certain extent by 
        changing the values of some global variables.

      * I moved the cpuBurnLoad50 test routine to a separate file, since 
        it is independent of the new implementation of osdCpuUsage; it gets 
	compiled to a stand-alone object file which you must link to your 
	IOC binary if you want to use it, e.g.
	TESTIOC_OBJS_vxWorks += $(IOCSTATS_BIN)/osdCpuUsageTest.o

iocStats-R3-1-11: Dec 5, 2012

      NOTE: For EPICS base 3.14.12.2 and below, this patch to rsrv.h
      for casStatsFetch is required (and a rebuild of epics base):
      http://epics.aps.anl.gov/epics/base/R3-14/12-docs/rsrv2.patch
    - move epicsExport.h inclusion to later for WIN32 builds.

      and brought up-to-date with the edm display by Stephanie.  Could
      use more work.
  * Change by Eric Norum and Stephanie Allison:
    - Add check for IOCSH_STARTUP_SCRIPT when setting startup script (after
      all the other existing env vars).
    - Support for RTEMS 4.10.
    - Move ENGINEER and LOCATION records from general env vars back to 
      IOC stats support.

      is epicsTime which gives a CPU load of 0% when ioc is not busy.
      Add code to prevent double init of vxWorks osdCpuUsage.

iocStats-R3-1-5: Mar 31, 2011
  * Change by Eric Bjorklund:

iocAdmin-R3-1-0: July 7, 2009
  * devIocStats - Ralph Lange made changes.  Here are his notes:
	Functionality is basically as before, the main work (quite a bit more 
	than I expected) being the split-up of all the devIocStatsOSD.c files 
	into functionally separate source files. (So that any single 
	functionality may be not implemented for an architecture and fall-back 
	to os/posix or os/default.) That split-up includes new names and APIs 
	between the generic part of the device support and the OSD parts, 
	which I tried to streamline, which allowed for some serious code 
	simplifications in the generic parts. I also made sure the new APIs 
	will make it a lot easier to support waveform records.

	I fixed a few bugs in the code (IFerrors and uptime under vxWorks) and 
	added (in the attached version) kernel version and CPU usage info for 
	posix systems.

	Added mem->total to the meminfo structure to create reasonable 
	information on soft IOC implementations with virtual memory 
	organization:
	   total:  on this host - physically installed memory.
	   used:   for this IOC - physical memory used at the moment (RSS)
	   free:   on this host - physical memory that is available to 
		   processes  (free plus cache plus buffers)
	Added memory implementation for Linux, FD usage implementations for 
	Linux and Solaris.
  * iocAdmin/srcDisplay - LCLS display update.
  * iocAdmin/src - Added python scripts by Dayle Kotturi for automatically
    creating a database and display with RELEASE module versions..
  * iocAdmin/Db - Add iocAdminSoft and iocAdminRTEMS databases for soft 
    and RTEMS IOCs.  Add MEM_MAX.  Process CLUST records only after MBUF_FREE
    records are processed.
  * iocAdmin/srcRestore - Add iocAdminSoft.cwConfig for soft IOCs.
  * configure/RULES_BUILD - Add rules for building a database and display
    with RELEASE module versions.
